# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics - ALX Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problems, specifically designed for ALX students. These solutions aim to provide clear examples and explanations of OOP concepts using Python.

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiating between classes, objects, and instances
- Exploring attributes and their roles within classes
- Public, protected, and private attributes and their use cases
- The importance of `self` in OOP
- Defining and utilizing methods within classes
- Leveraging the special `__init__` method for object initialization
- Understanding Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Exploring the concept of properties and their benefits
- Distinguishing between attributes and properties in Python
- Best practices for writing getters and setters in Python
- Dynamically creating new attributes for class instances
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- Exploring the `__dict__` attribute and its contents
- How Python discovers attributes of objects and classes
- Utilizing the `getattr` function for dynamic attribute access
